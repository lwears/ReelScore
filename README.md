# :tv: ReelScore :tv:

A simple movie / TV serie app for watchlists and scoring.

## About :thinking:

After 1 year working in cyber security I wanted to keep up-to date on the latest technologies and also maintain my web development skills. I chose the latest and greatest libraries and frameworks to play with which are listed below. I could have made things easy for myself by using 'create-t3-app' or 'create-t3-turbo' but sometimes when you use these boilerplating tools you miss a lot of the how and why.

## Tech Stack :toolbox:

- Fastify - Backend server framework
- tRPC - end-to-end type safety and api interaction
- Prisma - DB ORM
- PostgreSQL - DBMS
- Redis - storage for server-side sessions
- Zod - Schema validation
- Next.JS - frontend framework
- React - frontend framework
- Tailwind - CSS utility library
- TypeScript

## Requirements :receipt:

- docker-compose or podman-compose
- pnpm
- client secrets and ids for github and google

## :hammer_and_wrench: Getting Started

### Step 1: :rocket: Initial Setup

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/lwears/ReelScore.git`
- Navigate: `cd ReelScore`
- Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
- Build docker containers `pnpm run setup / setup-podman`
- Initialise Prisma `cd apps/api && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate dev`

### Step 2: :gear: Environment Configuration

- Create `.env`: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Update `.env`: Fill in necessary environment variables

### Step 3: :running_man: Running the Project

- Development Mode: `pnpm run dev`

## Todo :pencil2:

- Passport User as User?
- Dark Mode
- add is loading when loading new page on search?
- Map errors to better descriptions on FE
- Check if errors returned from tRPC

#### Notes

##### Tried to create a CrudRouter

Due to Prisma not having any generic for delegate, the TypeScript solution was simply too complicated for this project.

This also affected me creating re-usable components on the FE
